Difficulty,Question,Answer
Easy,"What is an ecosystem?","An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment, including plants, animals, and non-living factors like soil and climate."
Easy,"Name the basic unit of life.","The cell is the basic unit of life. All living things are made up of one or more cells, which carry out the basic functions necessary for life."
Easy,"What gas do plants release during photosynthesis?","Plants release oxygen gas during photosynthesis as a byproduct of converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose using sunlight energy."
Easy,"What is photosynthesis equation in simple terms?","The simple photosynthesis equation is: Carbon dioxide + Water + Sunlight → Glucose + Oxygen. Plants use this process to make food and release oxygen we breathe."
Easy,"Name three types of rocks.","The three types of rocks are igneous (formed from cooled magma), sedimentary (formed from compressed layers), and metamorphic (formed from heat and pressure)."
Easy,"What is gravity?","Gravity is the force that attracts objects toward each other. On Earth, gravity pulls everything toward the planet's center, giving objects weight and keeping us on the ground."
Easy,"What is the largest organ in the human body?","The skin is the largest organ in the human body. It protects internal organs, regulates body temperature, and contains sensory receptors for touch, pressure, and temperature."
Easy,"What is the main function of the circulatory system?","The circulatory system transports blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells while removing waste products like carbon dioxide."
Easy,"What is an adaptation?","An adaptation is a characteristic that helps an organism survive and reproduce in its environment. Examples include a polar bear's thick fur for cold climates or a cactus's ability to store water."
Easy,"What is a habitat?","A habitat is the natural environment where an organism lives and meets all its needs for survival, including food, water, shelter, and space for reproduction."
Easy,"What is pollination?","Pollination is the transfer of pollen from male flower parts to female flower parts, enabling plants to reproduce and form seeds. It can occur through wind, insects, birds, or other animals."
Easy,"What is the water table?","The water table is the upper level of groundwater in soil and rock. It's the boundary between saturated ground (below) and unsaturated ground (above), and its level can change with rainfall and drought."
Medium,"Explain the difference between weather and climate.","Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific area (daily temperature, precipitation), while climate describes long-term weather patterns and average conditions over many years in a region."
Medium,"What causes the seasons on Earth?","Seasons are caused by Earth's tilted axis as it orbits the Sun. Different parts of Earth receive varying amounts of direct sunlight throughout the year, creating seasonal changes in temperature and daylight hours."
Medium,"Describe how metamorphic rocks are formed.","Metamorphic rocks form when existing rocks are subjected to intense heat and pressure deep within Earth's crust, causing their mineral structure and composition to change without melting completely."
Medium,"How do vaccines help protect us from diseases?","Vaccines contain weakened or dead pathogens that train our immune system to recognize and fight specific diseases without causing illness, creating immunity and protecting us from future infections."
Medium,"Explain why ice floats on water.","Ice floats on water because it's less dense than liquid water. When water freezes, its molecules arrange in a crystalline structure that takes up more space, making ice lighter per unit volume."
